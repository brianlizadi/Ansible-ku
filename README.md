# Ansible
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy.

# Note
Running Playbook Ansible using this ```ansible-playbook -i hosts laptop.yml --ask-vault-pass --extra-vars='@passwd.yml'```
